1. Top-down:
divisibility is the operation (summation is an inverse) > 
arithmetic and number theory including > 
the statistical properties of numbers (how they converge and convolve).
2. In reverse:
the distributions can be 'stable' if they are summable (divisible) >
classes of distributions behaving like numbers >
their 'arithmetic'.
3. A vision of unities splitting in (p+q) and adding as links to a chain and the error function integral... Weierstrass.
